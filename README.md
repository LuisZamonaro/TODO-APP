I found the project idea on the FrontendMentor website and built it to practice my skills with React, TypeScript, styled-components, Express, Axios, among other technologies to be found in it.
To start the project, open the integrated terminal in the backend folder and use the command
   - yarn dev 
  or 
   - npm run dev
Simply repeat the same process in the frontend folder.
